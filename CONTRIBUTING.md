- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Run tests and linting:
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash

   ```

6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Create a Pull Request

## Code Style

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for custom domains
fix: resolve Caddy configuration issue
docs: update installation instructions
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific test
go test ./internal/app/...
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all exported functions
- Use clear, concise comments
- Provide examples for complex functions

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features
- Keep installation instructions current

## Release Process

### Version Management

Use the version script to manage releases:

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
./scripts/version.sh patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
./scripts/version.sh minor

# Major release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
./scripts/version.sh major
```

### Release Types

- **Stable releases**: Tagged releases from `main`
